# Learn-Easy
An application to help users learn a number of languages through a set of guided lessons and culminating with a test to analyze their learning and strengthen their weaknesses. Using the in-built leaderboard, users can track their standing among the pool of other users

Through the use of Java's SWING and AWT libraries, a simple yet user-friendly GUI was created with hassle-free navigation functionalities. Learned and applied the usages if JFrames, JPanels, JLabels, JButtons and etc.

To track progress a login feature has been added and new users provived a register feature. The user profiles, along with their quiz score and progress, are stored locally in a .txt. I achieved this functionality through the use of IO and NIO libraries.

Custom lesson can be created to best fit each and every language, along with an added quiz with as many question to judge the learning conducted. Concept of Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism and Encapsulation can be observed throught out the code
